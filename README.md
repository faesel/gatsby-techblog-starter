## üîß Configuration (REQUIRED)

This blog is setup to be easy to configure and get up and running. There are only really two sources of configuration required, in Contentful and in code. I have added some other optional steps if you want to customise further.

### Prerequisites

Before you can begin you need the following free accounts setup:

1. Google account for Google Analytics
2. Contentful account
3. Disqus account

### Contentful

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) is a popular API first content management system. Registration is free and it fulfills all the needs of this blog.

After registering on Contentful your able to define a content model for your blog. This basically represents the structure needed for every blog post.

Below are two ways to create the schema needed for this template:

#### Using contentful importer

Simply run the following command:

```
npm run setup SPACE_ID CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN 
```

A json template is located in the root of this project > contentful > export.json that contains the full structure needed.

**Note** The space id and management token can be found by navigating to `Settings` > `API Keys` > `Content Management Tokens`.

#### Creating it manually

The structure for this blog is as follows:

Name | Type 
--- | --- 
Hero | Media
Title | Short Text
Tags | Short Text, List
Slug | Short Text
Date Published | Date & Time
BodyM | Long Text (Set to markdown)

Once this is setup you can source your `Space Id` and `Access token` under `Settings` > `API Keys` to give the blog access.

###  In code

All the code changes needed can be found in the `gatsby-config.js` file. The main ones to change are as follows:

```
module.exports = {
    siteMetadata: {
        title: 'FAESEL.COM',
        author: 'Faesel Saeed',
        description: '',
        siteUrl: 'https://www.faesel.com', //Use the fully qualified url
        social: {
            twitter: 'https://twitter.com/@faeselsaeed', //Use the fully qualified url
            linkedin: '',
            github: '',
            flickr: '',
            email: 'someone@gmail.com'
        },
    },
}
```

Along with the config file there are also some environment variables that need setting:

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=CAN BE SOURCED FROM CONTENTFUL SETTINGS
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=CAN BE SOURCED FROM CONTENTFUL SETTINGS
GOOGLE_TRACKING_ID=CAN BE SOURCED FROM GOOGLE ANAYTICS
GATSBY_DISQUS_NAME=CAN BE SOURCED FROM DISCUS
```

## üí´ Deploy

The deployment script in the packages file is intended to be pushed to use GitHub Pages personal repo. Due to this it pushes to the `master` branch (with personal repo's you dont have a choice on this).
